Every Unit Plan repository should have the following.
* README.md: Unit plan template
* lessons/
  - Folder containing separate folders for each lesson.
  - Each sub-folder should be named __##\_TOPIC__ i.e. __00\_intro__
  - A lesson plan should be a pdf file.
    - We will not specify a specific format for lesson plans, but each one should include all lesson components including (but not limited to):
      - Main objective
      - Standards
      - In class exercises
      - Notes
      - Resources
      - Assignments
  - Each lesson folder should only contain:
    - PDF files
    - Source code files
    - Images
* assessments/
  - Any assessments & their associated rubrics
  - Even if the assessment is also in a lesson folder, it should also be placed in this folder.
* resources/
  - Folder containing any extra resources
