# Modeling in Data Science
by David Moste

-----

### General Overview
This unit will introduce students to different types of models used in data science. The unit will cover both regression and classification techniques such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and random forests.

---

### Motivation for Unit
I'll be teaching an advanced computer science course next year and would like to make use of one of my passions: data science. I think this unit would fit perfectly as a final unit to an advanced course as it would provide students with an opportunity to build a final project that involves making some sort of model that coudl support them in solving a more fundamental problem.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

---

### Tools Used
I'm debating between using python or R for this course. I'll get back to this section when I decide. If using python, I would probably use the spyder IDE. Obviously R comes with it's own glorious IDE, R-Studio.
